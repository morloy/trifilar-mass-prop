trifilar-mass-prop
==================

This project is about determininig the mass properties like the center of gravity and the inertia tensor of arbitrary object by using a trifilar pendulum.

It is the result of a [Project in Space Technology, EF1112](http://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/EF1112?l=en) at *KTH Stockholm* in VT14 under supervision of *Nickolay Ivchenko*.

The **final report** is located at [doc/trifilar-mass-prop.pdf](doc/trifilar-mass-prop.pdf?raw=true).

The source code is documented using numpydoc/Sphinx and a sample output is given at [\_build/latex/trifilar-mass-prop.pdf](_build/latex/trifilar-mass-prop.pdf?raw=true).

Since much of the project is based on previous work by *Ernest C. Vallet*, his report is provided for reference at [doc/Balancing\_FFUs.pdf](doc/Balancing_FFUs.pdf?raw=true).
